I'm Kai, a DevOps engineer with a decade of industry experience. I'm 66% dev (mostly Python) and 33% ops (mostly AWS). I have working experience writing in 6 programming languages - Python, Golang, and NodeJS being the strongest. I'm familiar with deploying to AWS, GCP, and Azure - and multi-cloud setups between them.

My career goal is to empower engineering teams to reach their limits of productive potential. I weave this into my DevOps engineering practice, via helping teams quickly deliver high-quality products and services. Lately I've been responsible for implementing large systems - like application monitoring, data pipelines, and deployment tooling - from scratch. Most of my career has been as an IC engineer, and additionally, I managed a small team at EnergyHub. I enjoy learning new technologies and best practices, and then sharing that knowledge with the rest of my team.
