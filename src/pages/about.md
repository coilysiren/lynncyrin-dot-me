<!-- editors note: this is the same content as: https://github.com/coilysiren/coilysiren/edit/main/README.md -->

I'm Kai, a DevOps engineer with a decade of industry experience. I'm 75% dev (mostly Python) and 25% ops (mostly AWS). I'm familiar with AWS and GCP, and would like more Azure to round out the set. I'm proficient in six programming languages - Python, Golang, and NodeJS being the strongest. My expertise shines brightest with deploy tooling and application monitoring.

More personable information about me:

- 👩🏽 queer trans black nonbinary woman
- 🎮 PC gamer, 40% anime by media vol
- 🌱 backyard gardener
- 💪 strong, tall
- 🎓 materials sci / astronautical eng
