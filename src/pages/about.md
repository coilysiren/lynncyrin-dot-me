I'm Kai, a DevOps engineer with a decade of industry experience. I'm 66% dev (mostly Python) and 33% ops (mostly AWS). I have working experience writing in 6 programming languages - Python, Golang, and NodeJS being the strongest. I'm familiar with deploying to AWS, GCP, and Azure - and multi-cloud setups between them.

My life's goal is to empower engineering teams to reach their limits of human productive potential. I weave this into my DevOps engineering practice, empowering teams to quickly deliver high-quality products and services. Of late my career has had me implementing wholly new systems for my employer from scratch, like application monitoring, data pipelines, and deployment tooling. Most of my career has been as an IC engineer, and additionally, I managed a small team at EnergyHub. I enjoy learning new technologies and best practices, and then sharing that knowledge with the rest of my team.
