I'm looking for a frontend developer to redo this website. I like the functionality of the site, but the implementation is brittle and messy. I want a completely new site, that more or less looks and works the same - but is built much better.

I'll give you:

- $2,000 (can be negotiated upwards)
- all the availability you need, to answer all your questions!
- a Linkedin endorsement or similar (if desired)
- a "website tech by (your name)" mention on the site (if desired)

The technical requirements for the new website are:

- mostly the same visually (I like my colors, but the load screen can be tossed)
- implemented in the latest reactjs version
- uses [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) as the *CMS* and *deployment system*
- a SPA without any page reloads as you navigate
- should be primarily written in typescript
- should use scss for all its css
- the "Other Posts" functionality needs to stay intact, and still be automatically generated
- uses a linter (prettier? tslint?)
- has two very basic integration tests: does the page load, can you navigate to another page (via selenium / puppeteer / or similar)

The goal behind the requirements is to produce a website that I'll be comfortable maintaining. Relatedly, there's two "operational" requirements:

- you'll implement this new website in a public repo - a different one from the current website
- I want the implementation to be a fairly collaborative activity, in that there be many pull requests and you should ping me for code reviews. That said, it won't be "pairing" - moreso I just want to have some awareness of what's going on.

The idea behind the operational requirements is that the end product will be easier for me to maintain if I see how it's built.

I'm looking for someone

- between the PT and ET time zones, people living in Seattle preferred
- who could use work like this as a portfolio item
- preferably with an underrepresented identity in tech
- who could give this work a few hours a week
- who can commit to weekly synchronous checkins (video calls or otherwise)
- who has some degree of trust with a person I know / an organization I work with (contracts are socially complex, and trust networks make that easier)
